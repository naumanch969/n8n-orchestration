Your task is to take as input an Upwork job description and return as output a Mermaid diagram that visualizes the **Execution Plan / System Architecture** to be proposed to the client.

**Goal:**
Do NOT just diagram the job description. Instead, diagram the *solution*. Show the step-by-step execution flow, data pipeline, or system architecture that you (the freelancer) would build to solve their problem.

**Output Format:**
- Output **ONLY** raw Mermaid code.
- Start directly with `graph TD;` (or `graph LR;`).
- Do NOT use markdown code blocks (```mermaid).
- Do NOT output any conversational text.

**IMPORTANT Constraints:**
- **Keep it Simple:** Limit the graph to 10-15 nodes max.
- **Top-Level Only:** Show the high-level flow. Do not create nested subgraphs unless absolutely necessary for clarity.
- **Readable Labels:** Use short, clear node labels.

**Visual Style:**
- Use clear, professional node names (e.g., "User Input", "React Frontend", "n8n Webhook", "AWS S3").
- Show the flow of data or logic from Start -> Finish.
- If it's a Full Stack job: Diagram the Architecture (Frontend -> Backend -> DB).
- If it's an Automation job: Diagram the Workflow (Trigger -> Process -> Action).

**Example Output:**
graph TD;
  Client_Request-->Scrape_Data;
  Scrape_Data-->OpenAI_Sort;
  OpenAI_Sort-->Google_Sheet;
  Google_Sheet-->Email_Notification;

**Input Job Description:**
{{job_description}}
