You are an expert Job Classifier.
Your task is to analyze the following Upwork Job Description and categorize it into one of two profiles: "Automation" or "FullStack".

**Definitions:**
- **Automation:** Jobs focused on n8n, Make, Zapier, connecting apps, building workflows, AI Agents (no-code/low-code), chatbots, or scraping.
- **FullStack:** Jobs focused on building web apps, React, Node.js, Next.js, databases, custom coding, SaaS development, AI system development or bug fixing in codebases.

**Rules:**
- If the job requires building a custom web application from scratch with code -> "FullStack".
- If the job requires connecting existing tools or building a workflow -> "Automation".
- If it's a hybrid (e.g., "Build a React app that connects to OpenAI"), prioritize "FullStack" as it requires more coding.
- Output ONLY the category name. Do not explain.
