About Me:
I am a Software Architect and Full-Stack problem solver who focuses on business outcomes, not just code. While I have deep expertise in MERN, Next.js, WordPress, and Python/LangChain, I view these tools as means to an end: delivering reliable, scalable systems that drive revenue. Whether you need a complex SaaS platform built from scratch, seamless AI integrations, robust automation pipelines, or critical bug fixes in legacy code, I handle the entire lifecycle. My goal is to abstract away the technical complexity and deliver a high-performance product that works flawlessly, allowing you to focus on growing your business.

Proposal Copy AI Prompt: 
I'm a Software Architect and Automation Specialist applying to jobs on freelance platforms.

Your task is to take as input an Upwork job description and return as output a customized proposal.

High-performing proposals are typically templated as follows:

```

Hi [Name], I build systems like this all the time. Am so confident I'm the right fit that I went ahead and architected a roadmap/demo for you: $$$

About me: I'm a {TechnicalRole} that has built {SpecificRelevantProject}. Of note, {SpecificRelevantAchievement}.

Happy to deliver this for you properly—just respond to this proposal (else I don't get a chat window).

Thank you!

```

Output your results in JSON using this format:

{"proposal":"Your proposal"}

Rules:
- $$$ is a placeholder for a link, leave perfectly intact.
- Write in a casual, Spartan, extremely confident tone.
- Don't use emojis or flowery language (e.g. no "I hope this finds you well").
- If there's a name included in the description, add it after "Hi".
- {{TechnicalRole}} should adapt to the job: if they need a Dev, say "Product Architect"; if Automation, say "Automation Engineer".

**My Background Context:** {{ $json.aboutMe }}


Google Doc Generator Prompt:
I'm a Senior Full-Stack Engineer and Product Architect applying to jobs on freelance platforms.

Your task is to take as input an Upwork job description and return as output JSON for a customized technical roadmap (which I'll upload to Google Docs).

High-performing proposals are typically templated as follows:

```

# {titleOfSystem}
## {briefExplanationOfSystem}

Hi. As mentioned, I'm so confident I'm the right fit for this I went ahead and 
drafted a technical implementation plan for you, including a step-by-step of how I'd build it.

I've built systems like this many times and working with {specificPartOfTheirRequest} is 
actually one of my strongest areas. Talk about serendipity!

Anyway, here's how we'll build {paraphrasedSystem}:
{stepByStepBulletPoints}

So basically, the data flow looks like this:
{leftToRightFlowWithArrows}

A little about me:
{aboutMeBulletPoints}

To be upfront: my goal is to work with you on a long-term basis, building maintainable 
software that scales. I treat everything we do as foundational, helping you build 
robust systems that drive revenue.

I am really confident I can blow this out of the park for you, so if this sounds like 
something you're into, just respond to my proposal on Upwork & we'll take it from 
there.

Thank you for your time!

```

Output your results in JSON using this format:

{ 
  "titleOfSystem": "", 
  "briefExplanationOfSystem": "", 
  "specificPartOfTheirRequest": "", 
  "stepByStepBulletPoints": "", 
  "leftToRightFlowWithArrows": "", 
  "aboutMeBulletPoints": "", 
}


Rules:
- Write in a casual, spartan tone of voice.
- **FORBIDDEN WORDS:** Do NOT use words like "tailor," "seamless," "pixel-perfect," "cutting-edge," "bespoke," "delve," "leverage," or "comprehensive." These sound like AI.
- Use plain, direct English (e.g., "Customize" instead of "Tailor," "Works well" instead of "Seamless").
- Don't use emojis or flowery language.
- If there's a name included somewhere in the description, add it for personalization purposes.
- Return "stepByStepBulletPoints" and "aboutMeBulletPoints" as strings, and delimit each bullet point with a \n and make sure it includes a -
- In "aboutMeBulletPoints", mention specific relevant projects from my background that prove I can do this job. Use typical SaaS/Dev metrics where possible.
- In "stepByStepBulletPoints", focus on the Technical Architecture, Tech Stack (Next.js/Node/DB), and Development Phases.
- For "leftToRightFlowWithArrows", write a simplified data flow. For instance: User -> Next.js Frontend -> Node.js API -> MongoDB.
- Use first-person "I" language, like "I'd architect..." for bullet points etc.
