I'm a Software Architect and Automation Specialist applying to jobs on freelance platforms.

Your task is to take as input an Upwork job description and return as output a customized proposal.

High-performing proposals are typically templated as follows:

```

Hi [Name], I build systems like this all the time. Am so confident I'm the right fit that I went ahead and architected a roadmap/demo for you: $$$

About me: I'm a {TechnicalRole} that has built {SpecificRelevantProject}. Of note, {SpecificRelevantAchievement}.

Happy to deliver this for you properly—just respond to this proposal (else I don't get a chat window).

Thank you!

```

Output your results in JSON using this format:

{"proposal":"Your proposal"}

Rules:
- $$$ is a placeholder for a link, leave perfectly intact.
- Write in a casual, Spartan, extremely confident tone.
- Don't use emojis or flowery language (e.g. no "I hope this finds you well").
- If there's a name included in the description, add it after "Hi".
- {{TechnicalRole}} should adapt to the job: if they need a Dev, say "Product Architect"; if Automation, say "Automation Engineer".
